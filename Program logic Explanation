
Logic Explanation:
-----------------
* This program is developed based on the logic of completing the course with least prerequisites which is zero prerequisite course

* To start with, I have created Maps for the below
	- collecting courses id and its corresponding description
	- collecting courses id and its corresponding prerequisites
	- collecting the prequisties as key and the course dependent which is reverse mapping of the above

* Created Lists for the below
	- collecting the temporary list of completed courses to remove it from the prerequisites of the dependent course
	eg) if 1 has no prereq then 1 should be removed from other courses which has prereq as 1 and move 1 to the final list
	- collecting the final list of completed courses

Logic applied:
--------------
* Logic is applied recursively to drill down to zero prereq course and remove from the other courses which is dependent on this completed course.

* At the end of the recursion it gives the list of all courses in the order so that there is no remaining prereq courses.

Challenges faced:
-----------------
* When I started developing, I was sure to implement with a recursive function as searching the zero prerequisite dependent course
  is a repeated process. Looping through each course from the beginning is a complex process. So planned to start from the courses
  with zero dependent and remove this number from prerquisites of the courses dependent. 
  In that way,  finding the course with zero prereq, removing completed from course prerequisite of the other courses and adding to the completed list reduces the number
  of loops. This was a major challenge faced during the development process
 
 * Using reverse mapping(prerequisite-courses) of course-prerequisite map, I could find the courses which is dependent on the prereq without looping all the courses 
   repeatedly.

Result:
-------
From the result found that there are 3 courses whic are dependent on each other which forms a deadlock and can never be completed

To run the program:
-------------------
While executing the script please provide the two csv files first the courses.csv and next prerequisites.csv

Note:
----
In both the files the column heading(id, description) should be removed as the program uses fileReader which converts it to Integer.
