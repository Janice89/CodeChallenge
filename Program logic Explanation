
Logic Explanation:
-----------------
*This program is developed based on the logic of completing the course with least prerequisites which is zero prerequisite course

*To start with, I have created Maps for the below
	- collecting courses id and its corresponding description
	- collecting courses id and its corresponding prerequisites
	- collecting the prequisties as key and the course dependent which is reverse mapping of the above

* Created Lists for the below
	- collecting the temporary list of completed courses to remove it from the prerequisites of the dependent course
	eg) if 1 has no prereq then 1 should be removed from other courses which has prereq as 1 and move 1 to the final list
	- collecting the final list of completed courses

Logic applied:
--------------
*Logic is applied recursively to drill down to zero prereq course and remove from the other courses which is dependent on this completed course.

* At the end of the recursion it gives the list of all courses in the order so that there is no remaining prereq courses.

Result:
-------
From the result found that there are 3 courses whic are dependent on each other which forms a deadlock and can never be completed

To run the program:
-------------------
While executing the script please provide the two csv files first the courses.csv and next prerequisites.csv

Note:
----
In both the files the column heading(id, description) should be removed as the program uses fileReader which converts it to Integer.
